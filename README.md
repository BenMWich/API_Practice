IMPORTANT: The default API key in the code is the public API key provided by Giphy, and it is very rate limited. If the images aren't loading you'll have to get a free private API key from Giphy and use that by inputting it into the "Update API Key" field. You can get a free API key by logging in [here](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/) and making an application. ([Giphy API Documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)).
