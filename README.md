# GifWeb
Simple API practice with the Giphy API. You can access the github page's site [here.](https://benmwich.github.io/GifWeb/)

IMPORTANT: The default API key in the code is the public API key provided by Giphy, and it is very rate limited. If the images aren't loading you'll have to get a free private API key from Giphy and use that by inputting it into the "Update API Key" field.
